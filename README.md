# Awesome Codebases [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of real world codebases to learn from

Since we're always learning new things, let's build a list of high-quality, real world codebases to learn from -- from libraries and standalone applications, to code from training courses and books. By studying real codebases, it can become easier to put theory into practice, and learn new languages, frameworks, and security practices.

What we look for:

- Well-written code

- Tests (lots of them)

- Good documentation

- Maintained

## Contents

- [Java](#java)
- [Python](#python)
- [Terraform](#terraform)

## Java

### Libraries

- [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) - A popular framework for Java
- [Apache Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel) - An integration library

### Applications

- [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) - The canonical example application to learn Spring
- [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) - A distributed, open source, RESTful search and analytics application

## Python

### Libraries

- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) - a framework for building APIs with Python
- [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) - a library for data validation
- [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) - a library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal

### CLI applications

- [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx) - an HTTP client for Python, which can also be run as a CLI tool

### Django web applications

End user applications which are implemented using Django.

- [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) - a network management web application
- [Edx](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform) - a web application for creating and delivering courses and online training

## Terraform

- [Book code for Terraform: Up & Running by Yevgeniy Brikman](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code) - **Example** code to accompany Yevgeniy's book
