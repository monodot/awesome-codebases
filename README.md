# Awesome Codebases [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of real world code and documentation to learn from

**I don't know about you, but when I'm learning new things, I like to look at existing codebases -- to see how they do it.**

So let's build a list of high-quality, real world codebases to learn from -- from libraries and standalone applications, to code from training courses and books. By studying real codebases, it can become easier to put theory into practice, and learn new languages, frameworks, and security practices.

The ideal projects for this repo are:

- Well-known projects or websites which you might already be using every day 
- Well-written code that follows the conventions of the language/framework
- Tests (lots of them)
- Good documentation
- Actively maintained
