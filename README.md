> A curated list of real world codebases to learn from

Because we're always learning new things, let's build a list of high-quality, real world codebases to learn from. These can come in useful for learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies.

What we look for:

- Well-written code

- Tests (lots of them)

- Good documentation

- Maintained
