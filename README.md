# Awesome Codebases [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of real world codebases to learn from

Because we're always learning new things, let's build a list of high-quality, real world codebases to learn from. These can take the form of libraries, standalone applications or even code from training courses and books. Real codebases can be useful for learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies.

What we look for:

- Well-written code

- Tests (lots of them)

- Good documentation

- Maintained

## Contents

- [Java](#java)
- [Python](#python)
- [Terraform](#terraform)

## Java

### Libraries

- [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) - A popular framework for Java
- [Apache Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel) - An integration library

### Applications

- [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) - The canonical example application to learn Spring
- [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) - A distributed, open source, RESTful search and analytics application
